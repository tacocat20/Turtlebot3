# Turtlebot3
This repository continues to be updated with code for my copy of Turtlebot3, which I made from commercially available parts and is not necessarily exact to the specifications of the actual commercial product. It is powered by 2 dynamixel XL430s and a Jetson Orin Nano running ROS2

This repository contains ONLY my custom nodes for ROS2 and does not contain the neccesary structure to run these nodes. In order to fully setup and run ROS2 go to "https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html". In development I used humble, but these nodes are applicable to other versions as well. Use a typical USB webcam for vision and a robotis U2D2 to run the motors.
